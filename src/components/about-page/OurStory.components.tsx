                    We, a group of General Assembly alumni students had an innovative idea for an app called Talk Thru. The purpose of the app was to connect peer-seeking learners with study partners. The idea had come about during a class project, where the students had noticed a common problem among their peers - they struggled to find study partners in the same learning stage.{'\n'}
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Determined to solve this problem, our group of alumni students decided to create the Talk Thru app. We put our heads together and worked tirelessly for six weeks, utilizing the Agile methodology and the Jira platform to manage the project effectively.

                    During the six weeks, the group focused on creating a minimal viable product based on one user flow. We took feedback from peers and iterated the design until it had an effect we were satisfied with. We knew that creating an app was not an easy feat, but we were passionate about solving this problem for our peers.

                    <br /> 
                    As we worked together, the group faced challenges and obstacles, but we were determined to push through. We stayed motivated and encouraged one another, using our collective skills and knowledge to overcome each obstacle we faced.

                    <br /> 
                    Finally, after six weeks of hard work, we created the Talk Thru app. It was a simple and easy-to-use app that connected peer-seeking learners with study partners. We were thrilled with our creation and decided to showcase it in our portfolios.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    The app received positive feedback from peers, who found it incredibly helpful in finding study partners. Our group of alumni students was proud of our accomplishments and grateful for the opportunity to work together on such a meaningful project. The Talk Thru app became a symbol of our hard work, determination, and commitment to solving problems for our peers.
